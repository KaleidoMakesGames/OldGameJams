  dialogue:
  - Are you the alchemist of this shop?
  - '.......'
  - Great. I couldn't find a single open shop in Gallia except for yours.
  - My name is Leogan.
  - '.......'
  - Well it's good that you've never seen me around. I'd be an awful Kingspy if you
    had.
  - Listen, there isn't much time. Have you heard of Scape?
  - '.......'
  - Exactly ... the legendary alchemist ... exiled years ago ...
  - Well. In a raid of his library, we found a plan to taint the Gallian aqueducts
    with some exotic poison.
  - My agents have recovered Scape's copy of the <i>Codex Alchemiae</i>.
  - The recipe for the antidote should be in its pages.
  - I need your help to concoct it. Here is the Codex.
  - Please, there isn't much time!
